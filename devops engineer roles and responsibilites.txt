devOps engineer roles and responsibilites:
============================================

I am currently working for the XYZ company  for the ABC client..this application is related to banking/telecom or etc domain..this application is created using java and NodeJs.As a devOps engineer I am involved in performing CI/CD using jenkins.our developers upload the code in to GIT and I have configured jenkins in such a way that it will get immediate notifications and it will download and bulid the code..the artifacts produced during the build process is deployed in to testing servers by the jenkins..the testing servers are running on tomcat...once jenkins deploy the application into testing servers it executes the automation test scripts..we have a testing team who create the automation test programs using seleium and Jmeter..jenkins will execute the functional and performance test scripts and if testing passes it will deploy the application into stagging servers where it will runs the automation test scripts created using cucumber in the UAT environment.if this also passes jenkins will deploys the application into production servers after taking approals from the delivery team..To configure all the stages I have used a pipeline based jenkins file.since we schedule multiple jobs parallely for every sprint we are implementing master/slave setup of jenkins where I created multiple slave servers to distribute the jenkins load..our sprint duration is generally between 3-4 weeks and we havve sub-sprints once in every 4-5 days...i have created multibranch pipeline jobs to perform CI/CD on multiple branches parallely..


since last 3 years we started implementing docker for creating entire development and testing environment as I told you eariler our appliaction is java based and our databases are running on mysql and for the application servers we are using tomcat..these entire environment we have setup using docker compose, similarly our testing team want to test the application on multiple browser and OS combination they estimated approximately 800+ browsers and os combinations on which they want to run selenium automation scripts..since creating such a huge network of 800+ browsers and OS combinations vm's is very difficult...initally we depend on a cloud service provider called saucelabs but it was very expensive..here I did R & D and proposed to my management that this infrastructure can be created using docker initially it was a challenging and time taking..it was really a good experience because I was able to create the required 800+ browsers and OS combinations as docker containers and run them successfully only on 6 servers for this I got appreciation from the client side..

I am also involved in creating customized docker images using dockerfile..these images i have uploaded into a docker private repository that i have setup on one of our servers..

we also started implementing docker at the level of production where we are implementing both kubernates and swarm..we are successfully handled all the production challenges like loadbalancing, autoscaling, high-availability, handling failover scenarios etc..initally we use kubernates now we are using docker swarm for this purpose..due to this reason I have working knowledge on both kubernates and swarm.. I also successfully migrated the pods on kubernates environment into swarm environment

we also have a datacentre in us-east where our applications are running on almost 2000 servers, part of my responsibilty as a devOps engineer is to create playbooks using ansible for remote configuration of these servers.. I have created playbooks and roles for remotely configuring applications like apache, tomcat, ftp, nfs, mysql etc.. I created these playbooks in reusable format so that anyone can understand and modify it based on requirement..we are also controlling docker activites on remote servers using ansible playbooks..I a also involved in creating python scripts for integrating and controlling all the devOps  tools from the level of scripts.
